# Next Session — Handoff Note

> This file is the starting point for the next session (a new chat, another Claude
> account, another computer, or a different agent). **Copy the prompt below and paste
> it — you shouldn't need to explain anything else.**

**Prepared by session:** 2026-10-14 (Open M3) · **Handing off:** **M3 is open.** The user
approved `/privacy` (Resend now listed as a processor, password storage stated) and gave the go;
`ACCOUNTS_OPEN = true` is pushed and the user was asked to turn on sign-ups in Supabase.
**Next: confirm sign-ups are on and check the live site from outside, then start M4.**

## 📋 Prompt to Copy

```
Hi. We're working on haci (formerly Hacı'nın Kokteylleri) — a Next.js + Supabase cocktail
site (hacininkokteylleri.tech) with an admin panel, growing into a community and mobile apps.

BEFORE YOU START, read these in order:
1. plan.md         — the single source of truth (status board, product, architecture, milestones)
2. next_session.md — this file (what to do, open questions, things that bite)
3. adr.md          — decisions already made and why (don't relitigate them, apply them)

Then do the work described under "This Session's Task".

WORKING RULES:
- Write EVERYTHING in the repository in English — docs, code, comments, commit messages,
  SQL — and every URL path, query parameter and setting too. Everything visitors and admins
  read (UI strings, recipes) is Turkish. I may chat with you in Turkish; that never changes
  the language of what you produce. See ADR-002 and ADR-015.
- The brand is "haci", always lowercase (src/lib/brand.ts, ADR-015).
- Don't reopen decisions that are already closed. If one needs to change, ask me first.
- Don't add features outside the active milestone. Ideas go to plan.md §9 "Icebox".
- The database is the gatekeeper: every table has RLS, every permission is a policy, and
  there is no secret key in the app (ADR-007). Admin powers need a 2FA session (ADR-011).
- Schema changes: apply with the Supabase MCP, mirror the SQL as
  supabase/migrations/{version}_{name}.sql, regenerate database.types.ts, run the advisors
  (ADR-009).
- Verify your own work before claiming it is done: `npm run build` must pass, and UI
  changes are checked in a real browser (Claude in Chrome — my Chrome, signed in to
  Vercel, Supabase, Namify, Google Cloud and Search Console). plan.md §5.4 has the commands.
- Use your own judgement on small calls; only use AskUserQuestion for things that
  genuinely change direction.

AT THE END OF THE SESSION (before context fills, even if work is unfinished):
- Update plan.md: status board, milestone checkboxes, session log
- Rewrite next_session.md: new state, new task, new open questions
- Add an ADR to adr.md if you made a decision that outlives the session
- Commit and push (main deploys to production — build first)
```

## 🎯 This Session's Task — confirm M3 is live, then start M4

### Step 1 — sign-ups are on

`curl -s -H "apikey: $KEY" https://qwvnhdghwycqlvsnlvlt.supabase.co/auth/v1/settings` (publishable
key from `.env` via `grep`) → `"disable_signup": false`. If it is still `true`, ask the user to
switch it on (Supabase → Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Allow new users to sign up → Save) —
the auto-mode classifier does not let the agent flip it.

### Step 2 — live check

From outside the office network (check-host.net, plan.md §5.4): `/`, `/login`, `/privacy` answer
200 and `/privacy` has no "Taslak" banner. Then once in Chrome on the live domain: the navbar shows
the sign-in link, `/login` → Google → `/welcome`. If a test account is created, delete it from
`/account` afterwards. Tick the last M3 box in plan.md and mark M3 done.

### Step 3 — M4 reviews and favourites

ADR-014 has the tables. The reserved-username list gets the English route words in that migration
(plan.md §8). Follow ADR-009 for the migration and ADR-014's grant/RLS pattern.

### Also open (not blocking)

The wordmark in the navbar; Hacı's own first admin sign-in (question 5).

## 🙋 Questions for the User

| # | Question | Why it matters | Until it is answered |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | **Colour theme:** keep the dark crimson "Rx" look, or explore a lighter/warmer palette? | The user said the theme can change (ADR-015) | Today's palette stays |
| 5 | **Hacı's first admin sign-in** — when (his phone, a network that does not block the domain)? | His 2FA factor is not enrolled yet | He cannot use the panel |

---

## 📍 Current State

- **Production:** `hacininkokteylleri.tech` (apex), `www` → apex, `admin.hacininkokteylleri.tech`;
  `hacininkokteylleri.vercel.app` → 308 to the domain. `main` deploys on push.
- **Accounts (M3, open 2026-10-14):** Google app **in production** (Google Cloud `haci-511515`, branding: home
  page, `/privacy`, authorized domains, no logo). Supabase: Google provider on, TOTP on,
  sign-ups **on** since the opening (2026-10-14, the user flips it). Pages: `/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/welcome`, `/account`
  (profile, **avatar** — new this session, sign out, delete), `/u/{username}` (shows the avatar),
  `/privacy` (in effect; contact `contact@`; processors Supabase, Vercel, Google, Resend, ImprovMX). All tested end to end on `localhost:3000` on 2026-10-13
  with the user's `wowcubey@gmail.com` Google account; the test account was deleted (all rows
  and the avatar object gone).
- **Avatars:** `src/app/(site)/account/AvatarField.tsx` (centre square → 256 px WebP →
  `{user_id}/{base36}.webp` → `setAvatar` → old object deleted), `src/components/Avatar.tsx`
  (picture or initial), `avatarUrl()` / `AVATARS_BUCKET` in `src/lib/supabase/config.ts`.
- **Supabase** (ref `qwvnhdghwycqlvsnlvlt`): 6 migrations, none added this session. Advisors as
  before (only leaked-password protection — Pro plan).
- **Admins:** owner "Efe" (`n.efeyigit@outlook.com`, 2FA), editor "Hacı"
  (`furkancam99@hotmail.com`, no sign-in yet, no 2FA yet). The two e-mail users in `auth.users`
  are these admins (no profiles).
- **Members:** none (the test member was deleted).
- **Search Console** (`wowcubey@gmail.com`): Domain property verified, sitemap submitted, Change
  of Address vercel.app → domain in progress since 2026-10-13.

## ⚠️ Things That Will Bite You

**Next.js 16 and the two hosts**
- Middleware is **`src/proxy.ts`** exporting `proxy()`. It also redirects the vercel.app host and
  refreshes the session **only** on account paths (`/login`, `/auth`, `/welcome`, `/account`);
  other public pages must stay static (ADR-005).
- The panel's pages live under `src/app/admin` but are **only** reachable through an `admin.*`
  host; locally **`http://admin.localhost:3000`**. Links inside the panel are written **without**
  `/admin`.
- **Never call `redirect()` inside a server action** (ADR-007) — return `{ ok }` and navigate in
  the browser. `redirect()` while rendering a page, and in route handlers, is fine.
- `src/lib/account.ts` is server-only (imports `next/headers`); client components import from
  `src/lib/account-config.ts`.
- **After renaming route folders, delete `.next`** — stale generated types break the build
  ("Cannot find module …/kokteyller/page.js").
- `next.config.mjs` redirects run before the proxy, so one list covers both hosts.

**Supabase**
- New tables are fully granted to `anon` by default: `revoke all`, grant only what is needed
  (column grants where users must not touch a column), enable RLS, one permissive policy per
  role and action (ADR-014).
- Write policies call `(select private.is_admin())`, which needs `aal2`. To test policies in
  SQL, set the claim and role inside a `do` block and end it with `raise exception` to roll
  back (this session's 16 checks did exactly that).
- `execute_sql` returns only the last statement's rows; `apply_migration` assigns the version —
  read it with `list_migrations` before naming the mirror file.
- A user who owns Storage objects cannot be deleted — the account page removes their
  `avatars/{id}/…` files first.
- Free plan: no backups, pauses after 7 idle days (keep-alive cron), built-in mailer only for
  org members.

**Google**
- The OAuth client secret is shown **once**; it is already in Supabase. If it is ever needed
  again, create a new secret in Google Cloud → Clients.
- Two Google accounts are in play: **Search Console = `wowcubey@gmail.com`**, **Google Cloud =
  `n.efeyigit@gmail.com`** (`authuser=1`).
- Keep `public/googlece68c38f8ad9ec89.html` and the `verification.google` meta tag in
  `src/app/layout.tsx` for at least 180 days — they keep the old vercel.app property verified
  during the move.

**Auto mode, permissions and tools**
- Never type passwords or secrets, never create accounts; the user does. **Chrome autofills
  the user's saved e-mail and password into Supabase's provider forms** — clear those fields
  before saving.
- `cat .env` is blocked by the auto-mode classifier; read one public variable with `grep`.
- In the Bash tool, a heredoc containing apostrophes (Turkish text like "Hacı'nın") can fail
  with "unexpected EOF" — write the script to the scratchpad with the Write tool and run it.

**Browsers and consoles**
- Use **Claude in Chrome**. Keystrokes go only to the front tab. The extension sometimes
  disconnects — call `tabs_context_mcp` with `createIfEmpty: true` for a fresh group.
- Google Cloud pages load slowly and their accessibility tree is often empty — use screenshots
  and coordinates; wait a few seconds after navigation.
- Namify's record-type dropdown: click it, type `TXT`, press **Enter** (clicking the option does
  not select it). Host name empty = apex.
- **The office network blocks the new domain** (a Fortinet FortiGate). Check DNS with
  `https://dns.google/resolve?name=…` and HTTP with check-host.net (plan.md §5.4).

**This session's lessons**
- **Google accounts in the user's Chrome can sign out.** At the start only `wowcubey@gmail.com`
  was signed in, and Google Cloud forced `authuser=0` ("You need additional access rights"). The
  user re-added `n.efeyigit@gmail.com`; it is `authuser=1` again. Check the avatar menu first.
- Google Cloud's "/" shortcut focuses its search box, and a promo banner shifts the page a few
  seconds after load — take a fresh screenshot right before clicking by coordinates.
- **The auto-mode classifier blocks** clicking "Publish app" without the user's explicit OK, and
  flipping Supabase's sign-up switch even with it — ask the user to do the Supabase switch.
- Screenshots of the `localhost` tab timed out (renderer "frozen" while in the background);
  `find`, `file_upload`, `form_input` and SQL checks still worked. `file_upload` fills a hidden
  `<input type=file>` without opening the native picker; files under the repo are allowed.
- A fresh machine has no `node_modules`: run `npm ci` before `npx tsc` (otherwise npx fetches
  an unrelated `tsc` package).

**Windows**
- A background `next start` keeps its `node` child after the task stops. Free the port by PID:
  `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -State Listen` → check the command line → `Stop-Process`.
- Git has no identity configured on this machine; commit with
  `git -c user.name=nefeygt -c user.email=n.efeyigit@outlook.com commit …`.

**Photos**
- Never overwrite an object in a bucket: new name, update the row, delete the old object (ADR-006).

## 🧭 Look-ahead

- **M3** live check → **M4** reviews and favourites → **M5** drink log → **M6** community
  recipes and feeds → **M7** showcase → **M8** Expo apps (the cherry icon is ready:
  `public/brand/haci-app-icon-1024.png`, `haci-play-store-512.png`; the adaptive-icon foreground
  needs the mark scaled into the 66% safe zone).
- Icebox highlights: localization (English first), colour theme review, a `haci` domain.
